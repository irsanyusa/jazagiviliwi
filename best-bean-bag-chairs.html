Typically, they don’t think about themselves lounging in a bean bag chair, but they should (or at least I think so). Because bean bag chairs are extremely versatile. They can serve as places to sit, lay down or even sleep (if big enough). Furthermore, they can even work as <a rel=alternate href=#>gaming chairs</a> or as a creative alternative to <a rel=alternate href=#>office chairs</a>.</p><p>Whether you’re looking for your first bean bag chair or a replacement for the one you currently have, I’ve got you covered. I’ve gathered a list of the best bean bag chairs (and what to consider before hitting that “buy now” button) so you’re best able to decipher which bean bag chair fits your comfort needs, space restraints, aesthetic, and budget.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-bean-bag-chairs>What to consider when buying bean bag chairs</h2><h3>Filling</h3><p>When shopping for bean bag chairs, it is important to take note of their filling as it varies from chair to chair. Although many bean bag chairs are filled with beads (with the most popular being Polystyrene beads), some others are filled with foam. In addition, if you are shopping for a bean bag chair for a household where there is a child present, you may want to ensure that the chair you choose is equipped with safety features, such as child-safety lock zippers to help prevent them from retrieving access to the small beads.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>Bean bag chairs vary in size and who they are intended for. With that in mind, taking a look at the size dimensions is important so you can be sure you’ll have enough room where you plan to put it and so that you’re able to comfortably fit on top. Some bean bag chairs are designed to accommodate many people (such as the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Yogibo Max 6-Foot Bean Bag Chair</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of the size, it is important to keep a watchful eye on very young children near bean bag chairs to prevent suffocation.</p><h3>Features</h3><p>Not all bean bag chairs are created equal. For example, some are equipped with armrest areas, while others are able to be quickly converted into a bed. Furthermore, some bean bag chairs come with covers that are able to be easily removed and cleaned in a washing machine, while others are made with stain-resistant covers that can only be spot-cleaned as needed. Other features may include multiple resting positions and storage space for items, including toys and blankets.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-bean-bag-chairs>Our top picks for the best bean bag chairs</h2><h3>Best value bean bag chair: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sofa Sack Memory Foam Bean Bag Chair</a></h3><p>When it comes to a bean bag chair with the best value, this one from Sofa Sack is a solid choice.

The supportive shape is closer to the experience of an ergonomic office chair rather than a bean bag chair you’d lounge on.</p><h3>Where can I buy bean bag chairs?</h3><p>Bean bag chairs can be purchased both in-person and through online retailers, some of which include Amazon, Pottery Barn, Bed Bath & Beyond, and West Elm, in addition to several others. I’d recommend purchasing your first (or next) bean bag chair online so that way you don’t have to lug those sometimes heavy boxes to your car. Plus, you usually have the ability to read customer reviews when shopping online. You also may even stumble upon some online-exclusive discount codes, which you can apply to then have your new bean bag chair shipped straight to your door for a lower price.</p><h3>Why are bean bag chairs so expensive?</h3><p>Bean bag chairs are so expensive as they are not typically designed to be short-lived pieces. The cost of bag chairs is largely driven by the materials they are filled with and covered by. With that being said, the bean bag chairs, which are made with higher-quality fills such as polystyrene beads and polyurethane foam, and strong covers such as canvas and vegan leather (for example) tend to be accompanied by higher price tags.</p><p>Furthermore, you’ll notice that larger bean bags designed for adults are more expensive than the smaller ones designed for children or teens since they require more material to make.</p><p>You also have to consider whether or not the bean bag chairs you’re looking for have any special features, such as being able to convert into a bed or serve as storage space as these factors may drive up their value and, therefore, the price.</p><h3>How long do bean bag chairs last?</h3><p>How long bean bag chairs last is dependent upon several factors, including brand, fill material, cover material, amount of use, and quality of care.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lkpqur3nBmp5mm5iWtrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-bean-bag-chairs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-bean-bag-chairs.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-bean-bag-chairs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-bean-bag-chairs.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-bean-bag-chairs.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-bean-bag-chairs.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./climate-change-hot-topic-democrats-2020.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./climate-change-hot-topic-democrats-2020.html>Climate Change Seen as Hot Topic for Democrats in 2020</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tech-what-21-famous-companies-websites-looked-like-when-they-launched-and-how-they.html>What 21 famous companies' websites looked like when they launched and how they look today</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tech-what-21-famous-companies-websites-looked-like-when-they-launched-and-how-they.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
