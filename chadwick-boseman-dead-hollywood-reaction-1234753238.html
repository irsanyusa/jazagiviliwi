Each time he stepped on set, he radiated charisma and joy, and each time he appeared on screen, he created something truly indelible. He embodied a lot of amazing people in his work, and nobody was better at bringing great men to life. He was as smart and kind and powerful and strong as any person he portrayed.

Reeling from the loss of my colleague, my friend, my brother. Nothing feels adequate. I always marveled at how special Chadwick was. Such a pure hearted, profoundly generous, regal, fun guy. My entire job as Okoye was to respect and protect a king. Honor his leadership. Chadwick made that job profoundly easy.</p><p>“He was the epitome of kindness, elegance, diligence and grace. On many an occasion I would think how thankful I was that he was the leading man I was working closely with. A true class act. And so perfectly equipped to take on the responsibility of leading the franchise that changed everything for Black representation. He made everyone feel loved, heard and seen. He played great, iconic roles because he possessed inside of himself that connection to greatness to be able to so richly bring them to life. He had a heroic spirit, and marched to the beat of his own drum; hence his excellence as an artist and the incredible courage and determination as he faced life’s challenges; while still guiding us all.</p><p>“He was zen and funny (with the very best laugh), attentive and truly, truly good. I can’t even wrap my mind around this loss. A loss resonating in my own heart as well as around the globe. The children he inspired, my heart aches for them, to lose their hero just as they finally found him. I am so thankful to have taken the ‘Black Panther’ journey with him. To have known him, spent time in his light and leadership and to call him forever a friend,” she wrote, ending the statement with “Lala Ngoxolo Kumkani,” which means “Rest in peace, O king” in Xhosa.</p><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/wzak5LB1pP</a></p><p>— Danai Gurira (@DanaiGurira) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 30, 2020</a></p><p>Meanwhile, Don Cheadle wrote, “I will miss you, birthday brother. you were always light and love to me. my god…”</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/DonCheadle/status/1299538219449552896</a></p><p>“Iron Man” star Robert Downey Jr., shared a video of him and Boseman on Instagram, writing, “Mr. Boseman leveled the playing field while fighting for his life…That’s heroism…I’ll remember the good times, the laughter, and the way he changed the game… #chadwickforever”</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=nofollow>A post shared by Robert Downey Jr. (@robertdowneyjr)</a></p><p>Tom Holland, who debuted as Spider-Man alongside Boseman’s first appearance in “Captain America: Civil War,” wrote a tribute on Instagram.</p><p>“Chadwick, you were even more of a hero off screen than on.
