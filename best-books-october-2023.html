This <a href=#>anthology</a> of new Black horror spans from the supernatural, like a girl searching for the demon that killed her parents, to the all too real, like traffic stops and lynch mobs. Other books on this list, though, border on the <a href=#>uncanny</a>: Walter Mosely’s Touched personifies death as a pale man with white hair and a dapper suit, and in Molly McGhee’s Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind, the titular protagonist enters other people’s dreams to scrub out the bad parts. Also arriving this month are the hotly anticipated memoirs from Jada Pinkett Smith and Britney Spears. Here are the best new books to read this October.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Out There Screaming: An Anthology of New Black Horror, John Joseph Adams and Jordan Peele (editors) (Oct. 3)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OutThereScreaming.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">First, <a href=#>Jordan Peele</a> co-created and starred in the sketch comedy series Key & Peele. Then, he made a string of films—Get Out, Us, and Nope—that fuse horror with the realities of Black American life. Now, alongside editor and publisher John Joseph Adams, he has collected and edited short stories by 19 Black authors into an anthology of contemporary Black horror. The likes of <a href=#>N.K. Jemisin</a>, <a href=#>Nnedi Okorafor</a>, <a href=#>Tananarive Due</a>, <a href=#>P.

Two decades later—and with six novels, three short story collections, and a MacArthur Fellowship in between—he has returned to the New York City borough. Brooklyn Crime Novel, organized into six sections, traces the crime of gentrification through a series of stories in the style of oral history.

Her glimmering debut memoir, laced with poetic voice, arrives with self-possessed power. <a href=#>How to Say Babylon</a> is a liberatory memoir in which Sinclair tangles with her past, patriarchy (“I would watch the men in my family grow mighty while the women shrunk”), and tradition and colonialism in her home, Jamaica. Babylon, in this case, refers to the oppression that the author’s father, <a href=#>a strict Rastafarian</a>, sees in the Western ideology. When Sinclair eventually moves to the U.S. for college, she reckons with the gap between her worlds and tries “to write the ache into something tangible.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy</strong> <strong>Now</strong>: How to Say Babylon on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>A Day in the Life of Abed Salama: Anatomy of a Jerusalem Tragedy, Nathan Thrall (Oct. 3)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/A-Day-in-the-Life-of-Abed-Salama-.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Nathan Thrall</a>—a journalist and former director of the Arab-Israeli Project at the International Crisis Group—conducted extensive interviews and research to reconstruct the tragic February 2012 day when seven people were killed in a traffic accident near Jerusalem. He tells this story through the lens of a father, Palestinian phone company worker and political activist Abed Salama, and his frantic quest to find his five-year-old son, Milad. On that day, Milad had been on a school bus traveling to a theme park field trip, but he would not survive the journey. His death, as Thrall illuminates through exhaustive reporting, was largely due to the systemic inequities of being Palestinian in Jerusalem: the wall dividing the communities, poorly maintained infrastructure, and an oppressive bureaucracy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy</strong> <strong>Now</strong>: A Day in the Life of Abed Salama on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The Leftover Woman, Jean Kwok (Oct. 10)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TheLeftoverWoman.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At 14, Jasmine Yang married her husband Wen in a rural Chinese village.

As Jasmine learns in a devastating twist, Wen, who wanted a son and was all too aware of the One Child Policy, gave their daughter away in an informal adoption. Upon finding out, she flees to America to escape her marriage and search for her daughter. She juggles two jobs to repay the smugglers who brought her: a cocktail waitress at a strip club, and a nanny for a white family with an adopted Chinese daughter.

He has dabbled in science fiction before, and now he’s back with Touched, an alternative fiction novel that is, in fact, very alternative. Touched follows Marty Just as something inside of him, an entity called Temple, takes over. Suddenly, Marty has strange new powers including super strength and the ability to resurrect the dead.

Around 1980, a North Korean maid travels from Barcelona to Russia to reunite with her son, and in the present day, a South Korean immigrant builds a new life after being incarcerated.

Tremor begins as seeming autofiction: Both the author and the protagonist, Tunde, are Nigerian, were raised in Lagos, teach at Harvard, and are cultural critics, <a href=#>photographers</a>, and writers. Butitbecomes more nebulous, a tapestry of perspectives, art and artists, race, and history. The title refers to the omnipresent threat of something—a strained marriage, casual racism, colonial atrocities—shattering the illusion of a less complicated, more carefree reality. Through an address to a late friend, a lecture at an art museum, and the voices of 24 Lagos residents, Cole sculpts commentary about life and art in an age of uncertainty.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy</strong> <strong>Now</strong>: Tremor on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>I Love Russia: Reporting from a Lost Country, Elena Kostyuchenko (translated by Ilona Yazhbin Chavasse and Bela Shayevich) (Oct. 17)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ILoveRussia.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I Love Russia might be the last piece of work that <a href=#>journalist</a> and activist Elena Kostyuchenko publishes from her homeland of Russia.

It’s a mixture of Kostyuchenko’s reporting—on the 2014 war in Donbas, Ukraine, the contract killing of six of her colleagues, the Russian government’s grim denial of the fighting in Donetsk in 2012—and her deeply personal essays. And the author makes a point to foreground the overlooked and oppressed: sex workers, queer people, especially in remote areas, the homeless, and Indigenous Nganasan people facing alarming rates of suicide.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy</strong> <strong>Now</strong>: I Love Russia on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind, Molly McGhee (Oct. 17)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/JonathanAbernatyYouAreKind.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After her mom passed away in 2020, author Molly McGhee was saddled with 20 years' worth of debt.

This is, in essence, the plot of her surrealist debut novel. In Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind, the eponymous character is also mired in debt—until he gets a job with a government contractor that sends him into the minds of workers while they sleep to scrub away anything that might be making them unproductive.

Her highly anticipated memoir, Worthy, is meant to change that. The book traces her journey from involvement with drugs as a young person in Baltimore to her close friendship with Tupac Shakur to her move to Los Angeles, where she would pursue acting and later meet and marry Will Smith. “Adventures of my youth, meaningful friendships, marriage, motherhood, self-betrayal and self reclamation are mere reflections of the adventures so many of us have taken in search of happiness,” Pinkett Smith wrote on Instagram. “It’s a harrowing ride of reclaiming my self-worth while unraveling unspoken truths.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy</strong> <strong>Now</strong>: Worthy on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The House of Doors, Tan Twan Eng (Oct. 17)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TheHouseOfDoors.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Tan Twan Eng’s</a> third novel is <a href=#>based on</a> W.

In The House of Doors, which was longlisted for the Booker Prize, Proudlock is a side character, a close friend of Lesley Hamlyn, wife of Robert Hamlyn. Lesley and Robert welcome Maugham, who goes by Willie, to their home in 1921 Penang, Malaysia, then colonized by the British. Tan effortlessly fuses fiction and fact as he paints a portrait of Maugham’s trip to Malaysia, his desperate search for a new writing subject, colonialism, and the restraints of heteronormative marriage.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy</strong> <strong>Now</strong>: The House of Doors on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>A Memoir of My Former Self, Hilary Mantel (edited by Nicholas Pearson) (Oct. 24)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/AMemoirOfMyFormerSelf.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This posthumous collection of more than 70 of Hilary Mantel’s essays, talks, and reviews, spanning 31 years of her career, does the beloved writer justice. Her work runs the gamut from the personal and poignant—like the surgery she underwent for endometriosis in her 20s, which left her post-menopausal and infertile—to the irreverent and clever—like her assessments of Princess Diana and Kate Middleton and her experience with a hypnotist. As the author of the Booker Prize-winning <a href=#>Wolf Hall trilogy</a>(a fictional account of Thomas Cromwell's rise to power), she also imparts plenty of knowledge about history and writing: “Ink is a generative fluid.

Because of that level of familial access, the book brims with material: conversations with his loved ones, handwritten lyrics, album track lists, and liner notes. While Robinson doesn’t speculate on Tupac’s unsolved murder, she does stay true to his “<a href=#>revolutionary vigilance</a> against a system complicit in keeping Black Americans powerless and poor,” as she writes in the book.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy</strong> <strong>Now</strong>: Tupac: The Authorized Biography on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The Woman in Me, Britney Spears (Oct. 24)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TheWoamnInMe.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other people have been telling Britney Spears’ story for a long time.
