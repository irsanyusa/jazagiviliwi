<time>23 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Many of&nbsp;you might remember <a href=#>The Truman Show</a>, the famous movie that revealed the life of&nbsp;a&nbsp;character trapped in&nbsp;a&nbsp;reality show. Although he&nbsp;didn’t know it&nbsp;at&nbsp;first, he&nbsp;soon realized that his life was being broadcast 24/7 and the only person that wasn’t in&nbsp;on&nbsp;it&nbsp;was him. His house, his neighborhood, his family and even his own wife were all fake! Any person in&nbsp;his life was hired to&nbsp;read from a&nbsp;script aiming at&nbsp;keeping the audience of&nbsp;the show hooked.</p><p>This story may have been what inspired&nbsp;TV that came after&nbsp;it: a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;reality shows where participants seemed to&nbsp;live freely, regardless of&nbsp;the constant presence of&nbsp;a&nbsp;camera recording their every move, from surviving on&nbsp;a&nbsp;desert island to&nbsp;finding digital love. Today, we&nbsp;all suspect that there’s more to&nbsp;it&nbsp;than what we&nbsp;see on&nbsp;these shows and yet, when some of&nbsp;those facts come to&nbsp;light, they still leave&nbsp;us astonished as&nbsp;to&nbsp;how naive we&nbsp;can&nbsp;be.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side,</strong> we&nbsp;attempted to&nbsp;debunk reality show myths and here’s what we&nbsp;found.</p><p><h2>1. Pawn Stars</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e3/e48/8cc93c5e809e1a2fac1db8c26d.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Harrisons</a> own a&nbsp;pawn shop in&nbsp;Las Vegas where collectors sell or&nbsp;pawn valuable objects, rare pieces, and unique models. That’s why the Harrisons often hire an&nbsp;expert to&nbsp;verify the authenticity of&nbsp;the object to&nbsp;be&nbsp;repaired or&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;valued.</p><p>The show is&nbsp;aired on&nbsp;the History Channel and is&nbsp;very popular. Viewers are especially drawn to&nbsp;scenes where Rick Harrison, his son Corey, or&nbsp;the family’s friend Chumlee discuss the right price and story behind an&nbsp;object brought in&nbsp;by&nbsp;a&nbsp;client. What sparks even more attention is&nbsp;the disappointed looks the clients have when they find out the objects they thought were unique and valuable weren’t worth anything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6eb/4a7/2b08405cb4b65ac386068bd60b.jpg><p>Although the shop does exist, many deals are arranged off-camera <a href=#>beforehand</a>. Clients are not strangers popping by&nbsp;for the first time right when the camera is&nbsp;recording: they first sign an&nbsp;agreement, giving up&nbsp;their image and sound copyrights. Otherwise, the show would violate <a href=#>Nevada’s</a> legislation already in&nbsp;place.</p><p>Unfortunately, these exciting bargaining scenes aren’t real since the price of&nbsp;every object (if&nbsp;it&nbsp;gets sold) is&nbsp;fixed beforehand. The <a href=#>protagonists</a> don’t work every day at&nbsp;the store&nbsp;— they only pop up&nbsp;when recording episodes that showcase previously selected objects. Despite the shop being very similar to&nbsp;the one that appears on&nbsp;TV, some parts like the big fan or&nbsp;the tourist souvenir section are left <a href=#>off-camera</a>.</p><p>It&nbsp;looks like instead of&nbsp;coming up&nbsp;with actual pawned objects, it’s a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;authenticity that audiences get from the show.</p><p><h2>2. Survivor</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ec/b91/057a995a45957b93a026c35b5b.jpg><p>A&nbsp;group of&nbsp;participants tries to&nbsp;<a href=#>survive</a> on&nbsp;an&nbsp;island for 39&nbsp;days. The lucky winner will earn $1&nbsp;million. This popular reality show broadcast by&nbsp;CBS allows viewers, from the comfort of&nbsp;their own home, to&nbsp;watch how a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;people will compete every day for simple rewards such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;toilet seat or&nbsp;dinner. All of&nbsp;these tests require real sacrifices and major efforts from the competitors.</p><p>While compared to&nbsp;other reality shows, Survivor seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the most <a href=#>genuine</a>, as&nbsp;the participants’ weight loss is&nbsp;noticeable on-screen. Testimonies from ex-cast members have given away small details revealing that not all of&nbsp;the sacrifices are true. Despite the hunger and isolation being real, producers seem to&nbsp;influence participants’ behavior and shape stories to&nbsp;make them more interesting by&nbsp;carefully selecting people and even suggesting options they hadn’t considered before voting depending on&nbsp;how “profitable” each character can&nbsp;be.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2bc/43a/636d8c5948a397d06bdcfb2404.jpg><p>Rumor has it&nbsp;that the show is&nbsp;staged with stunt actors and that participants actually sleep in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hotel. This has yet to&nbsp;be&nbsp;proven, but what is&nbsp;true is&nbsp;that they don’t always start campfires with rocks or&nbsp;magnifying glasses, but rather with <a href=#>lighters</a> and matches provided by&nbsp;the staff. An&nbsp;indulgent cameraman even gave them candy once.</p><p><h2>3. Storage Wars</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d26/c01/a103505172bb9b602e914b761b.jpg><p>A&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;Californian <a href=#>auctioneers</a>, Dan and Laura Doston, go&nbsp;through abandoned sheds and warehouses to&nbsp;sell off abandoned storage spaces to&nbsp;buyers. Buyers have 5&nbsp;minutes to&nbsp;bid once the auction starts and the lot is&nbsp;sold to&nbsp;the highest bidder. The show was very successful and a&nbsp;second season turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;A&E’s most-viewed show.</p><p>Later, ex-producer David Hester&nbsp;— who was coincidentally rehired immediately after being fired&nbsp;— <a href=#>blew the whistle</a> on&nbsp;producers planting hidden treasures in&nbsp;the so-called “modern Aladdin caves” before they’d get auctioned off. They also gave tips to&nbsp;participants to&nbsp;help them choose the best stores and even gave them money for more competitive bids.</p><p><h2>4. Pimp My&nbsp;Ride</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/441/8d0/f0d0565e6ea638b9297b3f9161.jpeg><p>Rapper Xzibit hosted <a href=#>Pimp My&nbsp;Ride</a> for MTV from 2004 to&nbsp;2007&nbsp;which, in&nbsp;part, launched him to&nbsp;fame. Every week, the owner of&nbsp;a&nbsp;shabby car would receive an&nbsp;unexpected visit from West Coast Customs’ team of&nbsp;mechanics to&nbsp;restore their car according to&nbsp;the owner’s personality. The makeover would often include all kinds of&nbsp;excentric changes such as&nbsp;trunk subs, luxurious chairs, and even integrated cotton candy machines.</p><p>But that not all that glitters is&nbsp;gold. It&nbsp;didn’t take long before 2&nbsp;ex-participants who were interviewed by&nbsp;<a href=#>The Huffington Post</a> made public that the cars were only renovated superficially. Motors and technical failures (which sometimes were a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;the makeover) were left intact.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/2fd/40d/b250af5f6badbb63eb49cf7274.jpeg><p>Rumor has it&nbsp;that <a href=#>spare parts</a> were immediately removed after the episode aired and that a&nbsp;single-car repair took months instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks like they claimed on&nbsp;the show. Participant <a href=#>Seth Martino</a> said the show went far from repairing his vehicle&nbsp;— he&nbsp;claims the makeover ruined his already damaged car! The seats’ LEDs would produce so&nbsp;much heat, the car became impossible to&nbsp;drive and the only part of&nbsp;the exhaust pipe replaced was the outlet.</p><p>Apparently, instead of&nbsp;mechanics, West Coast Customs is&nbsp;a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;professional makeover artists who are unaware of&nbsp;the damage they cause to&nbsp;the basic car functions. Lesson learned: digging deep is&nbsp;the way to&nbsp;go!</p><p><h2>5. MTV Cribs</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9e2/b29/3adfbb5bebbe81beadf2863330.jpg><p>Hollywood celebrities would open the doors of&nbsp;their mansions to&nbsp;show their luxurious homes throughout 13&nbsp;seasons on&nbsp;<a href=#>MTV Cribs</a>. An&nbsp;astonished audience would then gain access to&nbsp;the stars’ excentric lifestyles.</p><p>But once again, it’s wiser not to&nbsp;judge a&nbsp;book by&nbsp;its cover. As&nbsp;years passed, lawsuits and personal testimonies made public that the featured celebrities, who were on&nbsp;camera and sets, acted in&nbsp;mansions rented out by&nbsp;MTV specifically to&nbsp;trick the public into believing they were theirs. Besides the lying, the main problem was that sometimes the real owners wouldn’t even know their properties were being used as&nbsp;stages for the show and didn’t find out until they saw it&nbsp;on&nbsp;TV.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca2/87b/5b83ce571aa55c114a23ce7672.jpg><p>Interviewed by&nbsp;The Huffington Post, pop-singer <a href=#>Jojo</a>, who appeared on&nbsp;the program when she was barely 13&nbsp;years old, confessed that back then, she didn’t even own a&nbsp;house and that she had to&nbsp;borrow one from a&nbsp;rich uncle for the episode. Rapper Ja&nbsp;Rule rented a&nbsp;mansion where he&nbsp;threw a&nbsp;party that left it&nbsp;half-destroyed by&nbsp;the last day. Before MTV even made the real owner aware that a&nbsp;show had been recorded there, a&nbsp;lawsuit was already on&nbsp;producers’ desks.</p><p>When singer <a href=#>Robbie Williams</a> couldn’t afford to&nbsp;buy a&nbsp;house in&nbsp;Beverly Hills for the show, he&nbsp;borrowed Jane Seymour’s and naturally pretended to&nbsp;have befriended the neighbors while butlers —who turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hired actors— would go&nbsp;back and forth in&nbsp;the background. Jane Seymour accidentally gave the secret away during an&nbsp;interview.</p><p><h2>6. Hell’s Kitchen</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe4/a96/48e61955c4b74f7177a2c7e726.jpg><p>Created by&nbsp;Fox and hosted by&nbsp;Gordon Ramsey, <a href=#>Hell’s Kitchen</a> made 12&nbsp;to&nbsp;20&nbsp;participants compete against each other and in&nbsp;groups to&nbsp;prepare feasts and treats. The winner would get $250,000 and a&nbsp;head chef position at&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant picked by&nbsp;Ramsey.</p><p>Despite being based on&nbsp;the <a href=#>British version</a> of&nbsp;the show, clear differences were drawn. Instead of&nbsp;being recorded live, the show was staged at&nbsp;a&nbsp;studio without any audience during chef eliminations.</p><p>Gordon Ramsey’s reputation as&nbsp;a&nbsp;great chef precedes him just as&nbsp;his bad temper does. Both of&nbsp;these are clearly seen on&nbsp;the show while he&nbsp;runs restaurants efficiently, growing angrier and angrier as&nbsp;participants make mistakes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd8/8b3/abbcf759dc87643faaa2c1a645.jpg><p>Several <a href=#>producers</a> and <a href=#>cameramen</a> have witnessed how, despite not being staged or&nbsp;scripted, stress levels are heightened. This results in&nbsp;dramatic scenes that could potentially hook the audience. Producers would confiscate participants’ phones to&nbsp;prevent them from contacting their families and friends during the 5&nbsp;weeks that the show lasted. They have no&nbsp;TV either, so&nbsp;they spend their whole time there isolated from the outside world.</p><p>Participants work long hours, anywhere from 7&nbsp;in&nbsp;the morning to&nbsp;2&nbsp;at night. And afterward, if&nbsp;they want to&nbsp;eat, they have to&nbsp;cook for themselves in&nbsp;a&nbsp;kitchen shared with 3&nbsp;or 4&nbsp;roommates. Even if&nbsp;the most dramatic scenes are chosen during editing, cameras actually record them 24/7. In&nbsp;the casting stage, participants-to-be are chosen based on&nbsp;their passion for cooking, not on&nbsp;if&nbsp;they’re able to&nbsp;bear being on&nbsp;camera.</p><p><h2>7. Catfish: The TV&nbsp;Show</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/fe7/a6b/713490579489a98dff5ff7335e.jpeg><p>After creating the 2010&nbsp;documentary, <a href=#>Catfish</a> which explored digital long-distance relationships, Nev Shulman turned the idea into a&nbsp;series for MTV. “<a href=#>Catfish</a>” is&nbsp;an&nbsp;online term for people who create a&nbsp;fake persona online to&nbsp;appear more attractive and find love. Nev and his partner Max Joseph look through requests sent by&nbsp;people who suspect they’re being catfished and hope to&nbsp;finally meet their digital significant other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ef/27e/b638215c81ae543e544f2d7d41.jpg><p>Production takes care of&nbsp;everything: from meeting the catfish victim to&nbsp;finding their digital partner by&nbsp;conducting an&nbsp;investigation and background check until they finally reveal the catfish’s actual identity. The show digs deep into the <a href=# title=psychology data-link=tag>psychology</a> behind both the victim and the catfish to&nbsp;better understand the dynamic behind these relationships, whether it&nbsp;be&nbsp;fueled by&nbsp;low self-esteem, insecurities or&nbsp;whatever else.</p><p>But it&nbsp;turns out that catfishers aren’t the only <a href=#>liars</a> in&nbsp;the story. A&nbsp;production oversight was <a href=#>made public</a> revealing that most of&nbsp;the time, producers are first contacted by&nbsp;the catfish themselves, and then the victims are tracked, meaning that the whole thing is&nbsp;done backward. Once the victim is&nbsp;found, the camera starts rolling.</p><p><h2>8. House Hunters</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/58f/b34/0c105550c28b88b228422b7136.jpg><p><a href=#>House Hunte</a><a href=#>rs</a>’ production team joins couples and families who are moving and looking for a&nbsp;new place through a&nbsp;local real state agency. In&nbsp;every episode, a&nbsp;new family has to&nbsp;choose between 3&nbsp;different properties and perform a&nbsp;final interview once they do&nbsp;find something, and share any renovation plans and other insights with the audience.</p><p>But the selection process is&nbsp;not as&nbsp;real as&nbsp;it’s shown. According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>statement</a> given in&nbsp;2012 by&nbsp;HGTV to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Entertainment data-link=tag>Entertainment</a> Weekly, a&nbsp;guest revealed that one of&nbsp;the houses they visited had already been acquired by&nbsp;participants and the other 2&nbsp;had never been considered as&nbsp;an&nbsp;option but were only chosen to&nbsp;simulate some real estate competition. <a href=#>Producers</a> themselves confessed that to&nbsp;speed up&nbsp;the process, only families who already have had a&nbsp;house were contacted and their house hunt was recreated following similar plot twists. But can these stories really be&nbsp;authentic?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/805/151/8ae3bc521c8cc885a4990fefa5.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Mental Floss</a>, about 100 to&nbsp;200 people apply to&nbsp;appear on&nbsp;the show. After a&nbsp;fierce competition to&nbsp;try their chances at&nbsp;highly selective casting, the few participants who manage to&nbsp;get in&nbsp;make about $500&nbsp;a week.</p><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, some of&nbsp;the houses that participants pretend to&nbsp;buy are not even on&nbsp;sale. As&nbsp;revealed by&nbsp;<a href=#>Hooked On&nbsp;Houses</a>, homes sometimes belong to&nbsp;friends or&nbsp;relatives. It&nbsp;seems like this reality show is&nbsp;more show than reality.</p><p><h2>9. Man vs. Wild</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/98f/aac/ba68ec5a36b90f0f23f08810c3.jpg><p>Survival expert and British ex-marine, Bear Grylls, stars in&nbsp;Discovery Channel’s Man vs. Wild. Parachuted out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;helicopter and left at&nbsp;the mercy of&nbsp;the toughest wilderness settings, his goal is&nbsp;to&nbsp;show how to&nbsp;resourcefully manage to&nbsp;survive with only a&nbsp;knife and a&nbsp;canteen. Eating worms, live fish, raw meat, and even scorpions are just the tip of&nbsp;the iceberg.</p><p>Despite his incredible survival skills (his expertise earned him the nickname “The Real MacGyver” among his marine peers), this British Special Forces veteran is&nbsp;hardly as&nbsp;isolated, hungry and abandoned as&nbsp;it&nbsp;may seem during the show. A&nbsp;whole team of&nbsp;producers joins him off-camera and as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;lights are off they all move out of&nbsp;the wilderness to&nbsp;eat and sleep safely and soundly in&nbsp;<a href=#>local hotels</a>.</p><p>Apparently, even the wild horses that Bear Grylls rides on&nbsp;in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the episodes belong to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>trekking station</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/12a/964/940d7e543ca017135f2a705146.jpg><p>After <a href=#>graciously</a> answering every question asked by&nbsp;journalists from all over the world during an&nbsp;interview in&nbsp;London, when the rumor about the show being staged came&nbsp;up, he&nbsp;answered, “I’m doing a&nbsp;show that teaches basic survival techniques to&nbsp;the public. <a href=#>Of&nbsp;course, it’s edited</a>. It’s TV, right?”</p><p><h2>10. The Bachelor</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d35/8b3/a6adf25bfdbff0ac9b107fefd6.jpg><p>The season’s chosen bachelor joins a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;single women who, as&nbsp;modern Cinderellas, patiently wait for their Prince Charming to&nbsp;fall in&nbsp;love with them. The man is&nbsp;then invited to&nbsp;have group dates with the ladies who will later be&nbsp;ruled out until he&nbsp;finds the right match.
