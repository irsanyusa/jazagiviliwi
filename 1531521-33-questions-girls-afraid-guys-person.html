Women like asking questions because they want to know what they are getting into before becoming emotionally attached. However, there are many profound questions they are afraid to ask guys because they don’t want to appear pushy and scare them away. Some of these questions centre around relationships, the man’s body, and private moments.</p><h2>Questions girls are afraid to ask guys</h2><p class=align-left>Questions are a great way to <a href=#>initiate conversations</a> and understand each other. Here are some of the most common questions girls have always wanted to ask guys but they have never felt comfortable doing so for whatever reason.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8bb15ecc7ded98e9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ unanswerable questions that will absolutely blow your mind</span></p></a><h3>1. Do you want to get married?</h3><p class=align-left>When it comes to dating and relationships, everyone has different expectations. It might be helpful to find out if your partner envisions you as their <a href=#>future</a> spouse or if they do not intend to marry.</p><h3>2. What’s the most attractive feature of a girl?</h3><p class=align-left>Men have different versions of what makes a woman look beautiful. Many guys might focus on specific features of women, such as face, hair, makeup, and clothes, while others don't really pay much attention.</p><h3>3. What’s the biggest turn-off for you?</h3><p class=align-left>Every guy is different and might be turned on or off by entirely different things. Still, mustering the courage to ask about it might be hard for some people.</p><h3>4. What do you think about girls making the first move?</h3><p class=align-left>Generally, men make the first move on a lady they fancy. However, a girl <a href=#>can</a> get attracted to a guy she wants but does not dare to make the first move on him. The truth is, men often find it attractive when a woman approaches them first.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7e0d17abf099c363.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ being ignored quotes for when you are feeling overlooked</span></p></a><h3>5.

It can help you understand each other better when you share these things and can alleviate any fears you might have.</p><h3>6. What is your ideal woman?</h3><p class=align-left>Every man looks for a perfect woman even though the exact things they want in a woman vary. In general, men want usually someone with a good personality, light-hearted, with a <a href=#>sense of humor</a>, and attractive.</p><h3>7. How can you tell if a guy is interested in you?</h3><p class=align-left>You may think you may know a guy’s true feelings toward you, but then they go and do <a href=#>something hurtful</a> that leaves you in the dust. That's why figuring out exactly how to tell if a guy likes you can help you read between the lines and figure out exactly where you two stand.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fe931ad54816ae58.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ funny shower thoughts to ponder while you shampoo your hair</span></p></a><h3>8. Why did you break up with your ex-girlfriend?</h3><p class=align-left>This <a href=#>question can</a> be seen as prying into personal matters, and the girl may be worried about making the guy feel uncomfortable or bringing up painful memories. However, learning about your partner's past can come in handy when it comes to keeping your relationship healthy.</p><h3>9. Do you prefer girls with or without makeup?</h3><p class=align-left>Generally, guys prefer women with very little or no makeup. Some girls may not want to reveal that they are wearing makeup, and asking the question could draw attention and fear of rejection or judgment to it.</p><h3>10. How do you feel about periods?</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the embarrassing questions to ask a guy since some may feel uncomfortable discussing periods with girls, while others may be understanding and supportive.</p><h3>11. Do you like getting texts throughout the day?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7e0d17abf099c363.png><p class=align-left>There's nothing wrong with messaging your guy, but everyone has a preference on how much contact they want. This can sometimes depend on how introverted or extroverted your partner is.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2d1e179890d9d446.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Right person, wrong time: 13 signs it might be happening to you</span></p></a><h3>12. Who should pay on the first date?</h3><p class=align-left>This is often a contested topic between people. Thus, it's important to know where your potential partner stands on this before going on the first date. Usually, men are up for paying, but you never know.</p><h3>14. Can you forgive someone for cheating?</h3><p class=align-left>When infidelity happens in a relationship, it can be challenging for a guy to decide what to do next. Even though not many people would admit being okay with cheating, knowing your partner's opinion is still great.</p><h3>15. Do you believe in love?</h3><p class=align-left>Most of the time, situations may arise and cause instances that may make your <a href=#>partner question</a> their position in your life. Being assured that your partner feels the same way about you is one way to cement a relationship.</p><h3>16. How long does it take for you to commit?</h3><p class=align-left>Every man is different, but it often takes 2 to 4 months to get into a committed relationship. This amount of time allows two people to get to know each other on a deeper level and see if they are compatible.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/419f915b625f4c4b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is a bubbly personality? 25 signs you might actually have it</span></p></a><h3>17.

How many women have you slept with?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/12a62506d0641f09.jpg><p class=align-left>This is one of the questions that can incite so much anxiety, curiosity, and potential discomfort in a new relationship. It's wise for you to analyze your reasons for asking, but there's no need to get super serious or anxious when you broach something like this.</p><h3>19. Do you believe in love at first sight?</h3><p class=align-left>Sometimes all it takes is one look at a person to all in love. However, not everyone believes in that. Finding out whether your partner fell head over heels for you the moment they saw you can be scary, but it will also boost your confidence if your assumptions are correct.</p><h3>20. What part of a woman’s body do you like to please the most?</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/249c81a5be5c48fa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How soon is too soon to move in together?

How do you feel about your girlfriend having mostly male friends?</h3><p class=align-left>Some guys hate their girlfriends having male friends because they are suspicious of other men.

Why aren’t guys more in touch with their feelings?</h3><p class=align-left>Many men don't show their emotions because they're afraid of the repercussions. Some guys are also just more rational and pragmatic, preferring facts and logic to feelings.</p><h3>23. What is your greatest sexual fantasy?</h3><p class=align-left>Sexual fantasies are about pushing boundaries and doing things outside the norm, and men love excitement. However, women often don't ask this <a href=#>question since</a> they feel they would leave a wrong impression.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/51dcf84dd675f437.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is an exclusive relationship, and how should it work?</span></p></a><h3>24.

Do you want to have kids?</h3><p class=align-left>Both partners need to have an open and honest discussion about their thoughts on children to avoid any misunderstandings or disappointment down the line. Although, some women may worry that bringing up the topic about kids may be too early in the relationship.</p><h3>30. Is sex always on your mind?</h3><p class=align-left>Generally, men <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">think about sex</a> much more than women do. For men, sexual connection is often necessary to feel safe enough for emotional vulnerability. Ultimately, male sexual drive in a relationship is another path toward love.</p><h3>31.
