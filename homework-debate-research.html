Brandy Young told parents she would not formally assign any homework this year, asking students instead to eat dinner with their families, play outside and go to bed early.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the question of how much work children should be doing outside of school remains controversial, and plenty of parents take issue with no-homework policies, worried their kids are losing a potential academic advantage. Here’s what you need to know:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>The issue</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For decades, the homework standard has been a “10-minute rule,” which recommends a daily maximum of 10 minutes of homework per grade level. Second graders, for example, should do about 20 minutes of homework each night. High school seniors should complete about two hours of homework each night. The National PTA and the National Education Association both support that guideline.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But some schools have begun to give their youngest students a break. A Massachusetts elementary school has announced a no-homework pilot program for the coming school year, lengthening the school day by two hours to provide more in-class instruction. “We really want kids to go home at 4 o’clock, tired. We want their brain to be tired,” Kelly Elementary School Principal Jackie Glasheen said in an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview with a local TV station</a>. “We want them to enjoy their families. We want them to go to soccer practice or football practice, and we want them to go to bed. And that’s it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A New York City public elementary school implemented a similar policy last year, eliminating traditional homework assignments in favor of family time. The change was quickly met with outrage from some parents, though it earned support from other education leaders.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">New solutions and approaches to homework differ by community, and these local debates are complicated by the fact that even education experts disagree about what’s best for kids.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>The research</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The most comprehensive research on homework to date comes from a <a href=# rel=noopener>2006 meta-analysis</a> by Duke University psychology professor Harris Cooper, who found evidence of a positive correlation between homework and student achievement, meaning students who did homework performed better in school. The correlation was stronger for older students—in seventh through 12th grade—than for those in younger grades, for whom there was a weak relationship between homework and performance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cooper’s analysis focused on how homework impacts academic achievement—test scores, for example. His report noted that homework is also thought to improve study habits, attitudes toward school, self-discipline, inquisitiveness and independent problem solving skills. On the other hand, some studies he examined showed that homework can cause physical and emotional fatigue, fuel negative attitudes about learning and limit leisure time for children. At the end of his analysis, Cooper recommended further study of such potential effects of homework.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite the weak correlation between homework and performance for young children, Cooper argues that a small amount of homework is useful for all students. Second-graders should not be doing two hours of homework each night, he said, but they also shouldn’t be doing no homework.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>The debate</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Not all education experts agree entirely with Cooper’s assessment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cathy Vatterott, an education professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, supports the “10-minute rule” as a maximum, but she thinks there is not sufficient proof that homework is helpful for students in elementary school.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Correlation is not causation,” she said. “Does homework cause achievement, or do high achievers do more homework?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Vatterott, the author of Rethinking Homework: Best Practices That Support Diverse Needs, thinks there should be more emphasis on improving the quality of homework tasks, and she supports efforts to eliminate homework for younger kids.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I have no concerns about students not starting homework until fourth grade or fifth grade,” she said, noting that while the debate over homework will undoubtedly continue, she has noticed a trend toward limiting, if not eliminating, homework in elementary school.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The issue has been debated for decades. A <a href=# rel=noopener>TIME cover in 1999</a> read: “Too much homework! How it’s hurting our kids, and what parents should do about it.” The <a href=# rel=noopener>accompanying story</a> noted that the launch of Sputnik in 1957 led to a push for better math and science education in the U.S. The ensuing pressure to be competitive on a global scale, plus the increasingly demanding college admissions process, fueled the practice of assigning homework.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The complaints are cyclical, and we’re in the part of the cycle now where the concern is for too much,” Cooper said. “You can go back to the 1970s, when you’ll find there were concerns that there was too little, when we were concerned about our global competitiveness.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cooper acknowledged that some students really are bringing home too much homework, and their parents are right to be concerned.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“A good way to think about homework is the way you think about medications or dietary supplements,” he said. “If you take too little, they’ll have no effect. If you take too much, they can kill you. If you take the right amount, you’ll get better.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbGZrgHp8jqGmpp2npL%2BsecOemZqslWK%2Fpr%2FEmqmcoF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhomework-debate-research.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhomework-debate-research.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhomework-debate-research.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhomework-debate-research.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhomework-debate-research.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhomework-debate-research.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1121627-how-draw-eyebrow-arch-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1121627-how-draw-eyebrow-arch-html.html>How to draw eyebrow arch?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./francois-hollande-annonce-un-troisieme-comite-interministeriel-aux-ruralites.html>Franois Hollande annonce un troisime &amp;quot;comit interministriel aux ruralits&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./francois-hollande-annonce-un-troisieme-comite-interministeriel-aux-ruralites.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
