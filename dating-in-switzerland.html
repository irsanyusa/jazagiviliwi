<time>11 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Dating is never easy, but it can be especially fraught if you’re looking for love in a foreign country. Such is the case for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">expats in Switzerland</a>, who may struggle to meet new people (and figure out where to go from there). And even if you’ve already met someone, you may still need to overcome cultural differences and other hurdles to forge a lasting, genuine connection.&nbsp;</p><p>But don’t despair! In our guide to dating in Switzerland, we’ll give you all the information you need to find the right one (or just a little fun). We’ll cover dating etiquette, dos and don’ts, and the best ways to meet that special someone in Switzerland.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Swiss-dating-culture>Swiss dating culture</h2><p>True, the Swiss don’t have a reputation for being overly emotional or romantic — but that doesn’t mean they’re not interested in dating. Compared with other countries, the Swiss are known for taking their time in matters of love.&nbsp;</p><p>Conservatism might play some role in this, but a lot of people from Switzerland may simply prefer to get to know someone before entering into a serious relationship. Of course, there are also a lot of people just looking for a good time, and will behave differently.&nbsp;</p><p>After some years of decline in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">marriage rates</a>, slightly more people are tying the knot in Switzerland today — and slightly fewer couples are divorcing. While a lot of couples look forward to getting married, this depends on personal preferences. Many decide to share a life together without having an official ceremony.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-meet-someone-in-Switzerland>How to meet someone in Switzerland</h2><p>There are many ways to meet people in Switzerland. If you live in a town or city with a bustling nightlife, you could try meeting people in bars or clubs.&nbsp;</p><p>Just beware: flirting is more subtle in Switzerland, and being too straightforward about your intentions can scare some people off. Better to just have conversations for the sake of a conversation and not expect too much.&nbsp;</p><p>Nightlife is not your thing? No problem! In many cases, it’s much easier to attend local events or join a club with an activity that you have genuine interest in, such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hiking</a>, yoga or painting. This is a great way to meet like-minded people (romantically or not), especially if you’re new to a place.&nbsp;</p><p>All over the world, dating apps are becoming one of the most popular options for meeting a new love interest, and Switzerland is no exception. Apps with the most Swiss users include Tinder, Bumble, Lovescout and OKCupid.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id="Dos-and-don'ts-for-dating-in-Switzerland">Dos and don’ts for dating in Switzerland</h2><p>While it always depends on the individual person’s preferences, there are some cultural dos and don’ts in Swiss dating culture that you should be aware of.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Don’t be too on the nose</h3><p>It can be difficult to establish contact with someone you like, but you might be better off taking it slow if you want to spark a connection. In a culture where people are famous for being more reserved, it can come across as crude to start flirting right away.&nbsp;</p><p>The line is rather thin, though. A lot of people wait for someone to make the first move, so they might be delighted if you initiate a natural <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">conversation</a> first.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Be punctual</h3><p>Yes, punctuality is a big thing in Switzerland. This is not limited to workplace scenarios, but transfers to every other part of life. Better to be five minutes early to your date, as this can be interpreted as a sign of respect.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Keep it casual</h3><p>Depending on where you’re going out, dressing up might not be appropriate. If you’re meeting someone and want to make a good impression, the most important thing is that you feel comfortable. If that means that you’re wearing a suit because it’s your go-to outfit, fine. But dressing up for a date in a restaurant or coffee shop is usually not expected. The culture is generally more casual, so it’s best to keep it simple and comfortable.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Keep it simple and give it time</h2><p>Whether you’re looking for a long-time relationship, want to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">get married</a> or prefer something more casual, it helps to know about cultural differences when it comes to dating in Switzerland. If you’re new to the country, chances are that people might seem more reserved than what you’re used to. It’s still possible to meet new people at bars or clubs, but keep in mind that it could take time to really get to know someone.&nbsp;</p><p>If you keep it casual and (most importantly) are on time for your date, we’re sure you’ll meet someone special soon. Already met your match? A <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">language course</a> can give you the confidence needed to let conversation flow smoothly on your second, third and fourth date!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lea-Hauke-Foto-1-1.jpg><h2>Lea Hauke</h2><p>Lea is a writer and translator for English and German and lives in Austria.
