The fitted shape through the hips and thighs make your legs look longer and your curves curvier. You can wear them for a variety of occasions and situations as <a rel=alternate href=#>dress pants for work</a>, <a rel=alternate href=#>yoga pants</a>, workout leggings, or loungewear. The best thing about them is that you don’t have to sacrifice style for comfort.</p><p>Since they are once again fashionable, like everyday <a rel=alternate href=#>black leggings</a>, it seems as if every brand and label is making their own version, making it difficult to determine which might be best for you. We put together this guide of our top flared leggings picks to help you choose the best ones for you.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-flared-leggings>What to consider when buying flared leggings</h2><p>There are so many versions and iterations of flared leggings out there, that choosing one pair can be overwhelming. To help you narrow things down, consider the following:</p><h3>Length</h3><p>Generally speaking, the bottom flare of your leggings should not hit the floor. To determine what length you need, measure the inseam on a pair of pants that fit you well. The inseam is from the crotch to the hem. Most companies will have a size guide on their website that lists inseam length for each size. While it's always possible to hem a pair of flared pants, keep in mind that shortening a flare will make it less wide.</p><h3>Fit</h3><p>Try on your new leggings and test them to make sure the waistband doesn’t roll while sitting or bending. Implement squat and lunge tests to check that the leggings remain opaque while stretching and to make sure they don’t bunch in weird places.</p><h3>Material</h3><p>If you plan to workout in your flared leggings, a moisture wicking fabric with medium compression will suit most people best. Make sure the flare isn’t too flowy, it might impede your workout if it is.</p><p>For casual situations you probably don’t want a compressive fit, but rather something made from lighter weight fabric with more stretch and give. Wide flowy flares give off a dressier look.</p><h2 id=our-picks-for-the-best-flared-leggings>Our picks for the best flared leggings</h2><h3>Best budget flared leggings: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Topyogas Casual Bootleg Yoga Pants</a></h3><p>Available in a wide range of colors, these flared yoga pants from Topyogas are affordable enough that you can purchase one of each.

Flare pants work well on hourglass and triangle body shapes as they mimic the natural top curves. Even if you are neither of those body shapes, don’t let that stop you. Flare pants flatter the majority of people. If you are petite, consider avoiding super wide flares as they can be overwhelming.</p><h3>How do I style flared leggings?</h3><p>Flared leggings are easy to dress up or down. For a sophisticated look forthe office, pair a blazer and t-shirt with your flared leggings. For a relaxed, lounging around vibe, don an oversized button front shirt, a chunky sweater, or a cute cropped sweatshirt. The possibilities are virtually endless.</p><h3>What shoes do I wear with flared leggings?</h3><p>Most flared leggings tend to be on the long side, so thick soled athletic shoes are a great choice. You can also pair them with a short heeled ankle boot or a strappy sandal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1llqGus7HDZqOen5eeu6i%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-flared-leggings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-flared-leggings.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-flared-leggings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-flared-leggings.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-flared-leggings.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-flared-leggings.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./biden-administration-gun-export-regulations.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./biden-administration-gun-export-regulations.html>Biden Administration Tightens Gun Export Rules: What to Know</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./21-pics-that-exude-pure-happiness-812639.html>21 Pics That Exude Pure Happiness</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./21-pics-that-exude-pure-happiness-812639.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
